        <h2>Cairo</h2>
        <p>
          Cairo is the capital of Egypt and the largest city in the Arab world.
          Its metropolitan area, with a population of over 20 million, is the largest in Africa,
          the Arab world, and the Middle East, and the 6th-largest in the world.
          Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the
          ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industries in the Arab world,
          as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher learning,
          Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have
          regional headquarters in the city; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo
          for most of its existence.

        <h2>Alexandria</h2>
        <p>
          Alexandria is the second-largest city in Egypt and a major economic centre.
          With a population of 5,200,000, Alexandria is the largest city on the Mediterranean -
          also called the Bride of the Mediterranean by locals - the sixth-largest city in the
          Arab world and the ninth-largest in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) at
          the northern coast of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular
          tourist destination, and also an important industrial centre because of its
          natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was a major centre of early Christianity and was the centre of the
          Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in
          the Eastern Roman Empire. In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the
          Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage.

        <h2>Suez</h2>
        <p>
          Suez is a seaport city (population of about 750,000 as of August 2018) in
          north-eastern Egypt, located on the north coast of the Gulf of Suez
          (a branch of the Red Sea), near the southern terminus of the Suez Canal, having
          the same boundaries as Suez Governorate. It has three harbours, Adabiya, Ain Sokhna
          and Port Tawfiq, and extensive port facilities. Together they form a
          metropolitan area, located mostly in Africa with a small portion in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Railway lines and highways connect the city with Cairo, Port Said, and Ismailia.
          Suez has a petrochemical plant, and its oil refineries have pipelines carrying the
          finished product to Cairo. These are represented in the flag of the governorate:
          the blue background refers to the sea, the gear refers to Suez's status as an
          industrial governorate, and the flame refers to the petroleum firms of Suez.
